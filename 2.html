                <!--<p>Kerry Grant was born in the U.S. Virgin Islands on July 30, 1996. He was born into a Seventh-Day-Adventist christian home
                to Anthony and Jacinta Grant. During is life, Grant struggled to find a path to follow in life. He moved
                around a lot during his teenage years. When he finally turned 18 years old, Grant decided to leave his parents home in St.croix USVI,
                and moved to Ponciana, FL with his sister. He got a job as a Sales Associate at a Macy's, just 3 hours away by bus. He went to work everyday.
                Eventually he left his sisters house and moved to Orlando, FL to be closer to work.</p>
            <p>After a year of sleeping in different homes,
                life started to fall apart for Grant. He then relocated to West Palm Beach, FL to live with his brother, and to see what life he could make there.
                After 6 months with no job, and no hopes of getting one, Grant moved back to Orlando, FL and got a job at Jimmy Johns. There he worked and worked and eventually was able to rent
              a room for $125 a week.</p>
            <p>While working at Jimmy Johns, Grant met the love of his life. After about 5 months, she moved in with him in his little one room.
                Soon after life decided to take a turn for the worse. Grant had to unexpectly leave where he was living, and was forced to
                live homeless in his car for up to 2 whole months. During that time, Grant and his girlfriend drove all over Central and South Florida looking for a way out.</p>
            <p>While sleeping at Walmart in Hollywood, FL, Grant got a call from his Dad saying that there was a place that he could stay in Ocala, Florida.
                The next day Grant packed up and drove 4 hours straight to Ocala. He then got a job at a glass company. He then saved up enough money to be able to afford
                a studio apartment for him and his girlfriend.</p> <p>Then 2 months later his car got repoed, forcing Grant (and his girlfriend) to ride bikes 10 miles everyday
                to get too and from work. After about 7 months of riding this bike such a distance, Grant got a Job at Fedex Ground which was only 2.5 miles from home. All his life he has been very good with computers,
                but he never actually did anthing job wise in that field.
                Grant decided to do some research about jobs in the computer technology field, he then learned about Web Development and it caught his interest.</p>
            <p> Now, Grant is learning everything that he can about Web Development, and he has no intentions on stopping."I want to be among the best", says Grant.</p>-->
